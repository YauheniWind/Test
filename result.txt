White Sail Sailing
In the fog of the sea blue! ..
What is looking for in the country far?
What threw him in the edge of his native? ..

Play waves - the wind is risening,
And the mast bends and hits ...
Alas! he does not seek happiness
And not from happiness runs!

Under it a jet of light lazuries,
Above him ray of the sun Golden ...
And he, rebellious, asks the storm,
As if there are peace in the storms!
